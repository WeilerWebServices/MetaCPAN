***MetaCPAN***

---

***MetaCPAN*** is an open source search engine for the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network ([CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/)), an ever growing archive of code and documentation for the Perl programming language. This includes a comfortable web-based view and a first class mirror of the canonical CPAN content.

***MetaCPAN*** was born in November 2010. Since then it has grown old enough to have become an important and well utilized part of the Perl world, but it's also young enough to have room to evolve. As you will see we have many ideas and encourage more suggestions.

## MetaCPAN has two parts:

-   [metacpan.org](https://metacpan.org/), a front end to...
-   [fastapi.metacpan.org](https://fastapi.metacpan.org/) the API

So <https://metacpan.org/module/Moose> vs <https://fastapi.metacpan.org/v1/module/Moose>

***MetaCPAN*** is [a community effort](https://metacpan.org/about/contributors), with all the code freely available on GitHub ([www](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-web), [api](https://github.com/metacpan/metacpan-api)).

You can use and abuse the info you get from the API in any way you like. If you don't like the search engine, you can even use the API to build your own CPAN search. So, while the search site is the public face of ***MetaCPAN***, its true value lies in an API which provides Perl hackers everywhere with the power to build their own complex search queries for extracting data from and about the CPAN.
